COMP.CS.310 Concurrency / Spring 2021.


This repository contains the following directories
(that is, each project has its own work directory):

  * Directory : project-1

    - Save your design document in this directory.
      ONLY one file and in PDF-format ( e.g. Project-1.pdf ).

  * Directory : project-2

    - Save your report in this directory.
      ONLY one file and in PDF-format ( e.g. Project-1.pdf ).

  * Directory : project-3

    - The base code in main.cpp shows how to use the
      project library in single threaded application.

    - Compile and run using QtCreator ( open: rinn2021.pro ).

    - Write your all code in this directory ( you can change the
      main.cpp and add any new files you need ), but DO NOT make
      ANY changes to the library ( i.e. concur2021lib-directory ).

REMEMBER TO SUBMIT YOUR WORK IN PLUSSA!
Saving your files to course-gitlab is NOT enough, you'll have to 
submit your work to plussa before the deadline of each project
(instructions in plussa).


Files related to the voluntary project must be saved to directory
called project-4 ( create it yourself if you do that project ).
